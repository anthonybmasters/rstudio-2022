## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to host code relating to Covid-19 statistics.

The first project creates a graph of 7-day rolling average confirmed case rates for Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.

The second project shows confirmed patients in England by primary diagnosis and trust type.

The third project shows coronavirus-related measures in Wales.

The fourth project shows ICU patients by US states, according to COVID Tracker Project stats.

The fifth project uses Health Protection Surveillance Centre (Ireland) stats for notified deaths by date of occurrence and report.
